Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19,5,42,2,77], the output should be 7.

[10,343445353,3453445,3453545353453] should return 3453455.

Hint: Do not modify the original array.
