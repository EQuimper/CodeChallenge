# Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a `String` value,
it is called the `concatenation` operator. You can build a new string out
of other strings by concatenating them together.

## Example

`'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'`

## Note
*Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between
concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.*

## Instructions
 - Build myStr from the strings `"This is the start. "` and `"This is the end."` using the `+` operator.

### Before

```javascript
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr;
```

### Answers

```javascript
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = 'This is the start. ' + 'This is the end.';
```
