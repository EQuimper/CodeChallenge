# Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a `while loop`, because
it runs `while` a specified condition is true and **stops once
that condition is no longer true**.

```javascript
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
```

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

## Instructions
 - Push the numbers 0 through 4 to `myArray` using a `while loop`.

### Before

```javascript
// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
```

### Answers

// Setup
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
let i = 5;
while(i >= 0) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i--;
}
