# Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes 
referred to as `floating` point `numbers` or `floats`.

## Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. 
This can lead to rounding errors. [Details Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems).

## Instructions
 - Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).

### Before

```javascript
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
```

### Answers

```javascript

var ourDecimal = 5.7;

var myDecimal = 5.7;
```
