# Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

## Example

```javascript
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```

## Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder 
of the division of the number by 2.

```javascript
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
```

## Note
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, 
but does not work properly with negative numbers.

## Instructions
 - Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.
