# Reverse Arrays with reverse

You can use the `reverse` method to `reverse` the elements of an `array`.

`reverse` is another `array` method that alters the `array` in place,
but it also returns the reversed array.

```javascript
var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.reverse();
returns [3, 2, 1]
```

Use reverse to reverse the array variable and assign it to newArray.

### Before

```javascript
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

newArray = array;
```

### Answers

```javascript
var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

newArray = array.reverse();
```
