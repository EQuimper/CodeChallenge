# Declare String Variables

Previously we have used the code

`var myName = "your name";`

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a
series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

## Instructions
 - Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign
them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
