# Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables 

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to 
have multiple distinct 
variables with the same name but different casing.
It is strongly recommended that for the sake of 
clarity, you do not use this language feature.

## Best Practice
Write variable names in Javascript in `camelCase`. In `camelCase`, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

## Examples:

```javascript
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;
```

## Instructions
 - Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
 - Do not create any new variables.
 

### Answers

```javascript
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

```
