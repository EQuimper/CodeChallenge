# Build JavaScript Objects

You may have heard the term `object` before.

`Objects` are similar to `arrays`, except that instead of using `indexes`
to access and modify their data, you access the `data` in `objects`
through what are called properties.

Here's a sample `object`:

```javascript
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```

`Objects` are useful for storing `data` in a structured way, and can
represent real world `objects`, like a cat.

## Instructions
 - Make an object that represents a dog called `myDog` which contains
 the properties `name` (`a string`), `legs`, `tails` and `friends`.

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as
long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends"
is an `array`.

### Before

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {




};
```

### Answers

```javascript
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Lola",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Sam", "Sarah"]
};
