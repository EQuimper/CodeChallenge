# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use `bracket notation` to get the character at other positions
within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is
actually the zeroth character.

## Instructions
 - Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the
 `lastName` variable using `bracket notation`.

##Hint
 - Try looking at the `secondLetterOfFirstName` variable declaration if you get
 stuck.

### Before

```javascript
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName;
```

### Answers

```javascript
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
```
